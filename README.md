ModernMembership
================

A modern asp.net membership, totally unrelated to the MS one. Work in progress.

##Why Modern

- Developed using TDD
- DDD support via Domain Events i.e every model change will generate (but not send) a domain event
- Support for integrating with third party sites 
- Storage agnostic. Persistence is abstracted via Repository or Services


That's it for now :)
